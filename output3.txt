Graph Network Topology: Complete Topology
Number of Objects: 6
Random Initial Source Permutation: No
Source Permutation (Initial Assignment): 2 1 4 6 3 5 
Target Permutation: 1 2 3 4 5 6 


Upper Bound (the diameter of complete transposition graph CT_n for n=6) : 5 (i.e.,n-1 for n=6).

The minimum number of adjacent swaps needed is 4.
